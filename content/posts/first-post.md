Greetings,

Zavaneau is a dedicated social media account where poetry, spoken word events, and creative writing are shared, circulating primarily in Southern California.

This account was created by Diego Zavala-Morineau, a poet and English major studying Caribbean critical theory, histories of class struggle, and creative writing.

Expect promotional material, writing, Zines, photography, artwork, exhibition, and performance. Remain attentive.

In solidarity,
