**Zavaneau (zavaneau) is the passion-project and alias of Diego Eduardo Zavala-Morineau,** the author, poet, student, activist, and incumbent academic in histories of class struggle, Caribbean critical theory, and experimental literature, performance, and art. Zavaneau/Diego's creative writing concerns grief, love,  global politics, revolution, corporeality, longing, and Cachanilla-Chicanismo.

Diego was born in San Diego, California, on July 1st 2003 to a Mexican mother and a Chicano father. From an early age, Diego struggled with reading and writing, but that didn’t stop him from finding creative outlets and telling the most outrageous stories to his friends and family. After he attended his first poetry slam in high school, Diego’s passion for traditions in the humanities blossomed. 

In 2024, Diego published his first collected works,  poetry in my own time, and poetry and interviews to the City Works Journal in 2025. Diego writes poetry and political commentary on Medium and Substack. Diego was a work-study for the San Diego City College English Department  as a teaching assistant for the Hermanos Unidos Brothers United Program in Intermediate Composition, and worked part time as a independent research assistant and editor. His fourthcoming work will be featured in the 2026 issue of the Agave Review.

Diego has also been part of numerous organizations, not limited to the ACLU, the Youth V. Oil Campaign,  the HTHCV Alumni Mentorship Program, SJP and MEChA de City College, the AFT Guild 1911, and is currently a member of the Claremont Student Workers Alliance. 

Diego studied Engineering at UC Berkeley through the SEEDS Scholars Honors Program from 2021-2022. In 2025, Diego graduated with an Associates of Arts with honors in English from San Diego City College. Currently, he is studying History and English at Pomona College.
